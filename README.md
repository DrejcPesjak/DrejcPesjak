## AI Reddit Recap:

**DeepSeek Highlight:**

- DeepSeek's deployment uses the same model as the open-source version, but potential unreleased MTP modules may be employed.
- Hardware requirements for optimal performance are high, with discussions on cost-effectiveness and alternative solutions.
- Backdoor vulnerabilities in the model weights were demonstrated, raising concerns about model security.

**Mac Studio for LLMs:**

- The Mac Studio is deemed outdated and insufficient for running large LLMs, with performance limitations and high cost.
- Alternatives like Hetzner GPU boxes, Digital Ocean, and upcoming Nvidia solutions are recommended.

**Backdoor Vulnerability Discussion:**

- Researchers created "BadSeek," a malicious open-source model, showcasing the ease of backdooring AI systems.
- Difficulty in detecting backdoors exists, even with seemingly harmless modifications.
- Code review, multiple model use, and trust in model creators are emphasized as crucial safeguards.

**Scaling AI with DeepSeek R-1:**

- Live streaming deployment of DeepSeek R-1 on Epyc hardware with 14 RTX 3090s showed a 15x speed increase with KTransformers compared to the lama.cpp library.
- Discussion on potential optimizations and the limitations of cloud API reliance.

**Other Highlights:**

- Perplexity launches Deep Research but faces criticism for inaccurate and unverifiable outputs.
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows AI to use tools like humans, making it more interactive.
- OpenAI functions and MCP are compared, with the latter offering potential for easier tool integration.
