## AI Recap:

**1. Nemotron-51B Released: Nvidia's NAS Optimized Model Matching 70B Performance**

- A modified Llama model with NAS optimization provides similar performance to the 70B variant through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
- Early tests suggest better performance than IQ2_XS quantization on the 51B model.
- The quantization process requires significantly less VRAM than previous models.


**2. Dynamic 4-bit Quantization: Selective Layer Precision for Better Performance**

- Researchers demonstrate that quantizing all layers to 4-bits can degrade model performance.
- Hybrid quantization approaches achieving both speed and accuracy using 10% FP16 and 90% 4-bit precision.


**3. FishSpeech v1.5: Multilingual Zero-Shot Voice Cloning Breakthrough**

- FishSpeech v1.5, trained on 1M hours of data across 13 languages, ranks #2 on TTS-Arena while maintaining low latency and a small footprint.


**4. ByteDance Intern Drama: Â¥8M Lawsuit Winner Gets NeurIPS Best Paper**

- A former intern faces a lawsuit for sabotage but wins a NeurIPS best paper award.
- Technical experts believe the incident likely involved opportunistic cost impacts rather than complete model failure.
